# CS Interview Prep
A repo-in-progress, helps provide a basic and simple review of common data structures and algorithms for tech interviews. This is not meant to be too in-depth, just a "cheat sheet" style repo for quick refreshers. Includes comments to explain step-by-step what each part of the code does.  

I have plans to implement everything using C, Java, and Python. Includes Makefiles to help compile and run code. I am also looking to put my code up on a website for easier access and a better way to review the material.

If you are interesting in helping with this project, feel free to implement some of the unfinished data structures or algorithms and submit a pull request!   
   
Must know Data Structures:

* Linked List
* Queue
* Stack
* Tree

  * (In progress) Linked List
* C:
  * (In progress) Linked List

Current Algorithms Implemented:
* Python:
  * Mergesort
  * Quickselect
  * Quicksort
  * BFS
  * DFS
  * Kosaraju's Strongly Connected Components
  * Dijkstras
* Java:
  * Some Leetcode problems I found were difficult or essential to know

Planned algorithm implementations:
* Common graph algorithms: TSP, MST, Ford-Fulkerson, etc.
* Common DP problems: Knapsack and Longest Increasing Subsequence.
* Other good Leetcode interview questions.

I use reference material from the book *Algorithms* by S. Dasgupta, C.H. Papadimitriou, and U.V. Vazirani; GeeksforGeeks.org; *Cracking the Coding Interview* by Gayle Laakmann McDowell; and Leetcode.com
