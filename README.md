# Data-Structs-and-Algs 
A repo-in-progress, helps provide a basic and simple review of common data structures and algorithms for tech interviews. This is not meant to be too in-depth, just a "cheat sheet" style repo for quick refreshers. Includes comments to explain step-by-step what each part of the code does.  

I have plans to implement everything using C, Java, and Python. Includes Makefiles to help compile and run code. I am also looking to put my code up on a website for easier access and a better way to review the material.

Current Data Structures Implemented:  
* Java: 
  * Linked List
  * Binary Search Tree
  * Queue
  * Stack
* Python:
  * Linked List
* C:
  * Linked List
  
Current Algorithms Implemented:
* Python:
  * Mergesort
  * Quickselect
  * Quicksort
  
Planned algorithm implementations:
* Common graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, TSP, MST, Ford-Fulkerson, etc.
* Common DP problems: Knapsack and Longest Increasing Subsequence.
* Other common harder Leetcode interview questions.

I use reference material from the book *Algorithms* by S. Dasgupta, C.H. Papadimitriou, and U.V. Vazirani; GeeksforGeeks.org; *Cracking the Coding Interview* by Gayle Laakmann McDowell; and Leetcode.com
